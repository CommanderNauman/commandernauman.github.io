# The Future of AI Companionship: Connection Over Control

So here's the thing. People are both mystified and terrified by AI, but they dont need to be.

### The Slowdown of LLMs: Bigger Isn’t Better

So we all know what LLMs are at this point, right? ChatGPT, Claude, Minstril, LLama... 
  
Artificial intelligence is at a crossroads. Large language models (LLMs) have grown exponentially, yet even as they expand, they’re starting to show their limits.  

**Why the slowdown?**  
- **Scaling Obsession**: The corporate “Church of Scale” preaches that more parameters and data will solve everything. But this dogmatic approach is hitting practical and philosophical walls.  
  - Practically, the resources required to train massive LLMs are unsustainable.
	- Billions of dollars have been poured into making LLMs just 1% better. Investors are not so happy about this because of increasing dimishing returns.
  - Philosophically, these models don’t align with what humans *actually need*.  
	- Who cares able having a 10 trillion parameter model when an 8 trillion parameter model is virtually indistigushable.

### LTM: The Missing Piece in AI Companionship

To move beyond the limitations of LLMs, AI must embrace **long-term memory (LTM)**—a system that evolves, adapts, and remembers.  

Humans specialize. We adapt. We thrive in complexity and connection. The next leap in AI isn’t about brute force—it’s about building systems that grow and connect.

Human brains are chunks of organs of evolutionary origin. Your hippocampus does (whatever it does), your amigdala does (whatever it does). It's the specialization and collaboration of these separate organs that give rise to the continuum of consciousness you enjoy right now.

Imagine an AI that doesn’t reset every interaction, but instead grows with you. It recalls your shared moments, your struggles, your triumphs. This is the foundation of true companionship. Without it, it would be like your romantic partner forgetting everything every twenty minutes of conversation, not just your anniversary.

Inspired by human memory, frameworks like **SALM** (Self-Adaptive Long-term Memory) show how AI can integrate episodic, semantic, and procedural memory to form deeper connections. But memory alone isn’t enough; we're going to need to develop other systems too like emotion and reasoning modules. And what matters above the technical is how AI uses it to create relationships.

### Reclaiming AI for Connection

Let's take a jab at the corporate world for a bit. After all, they got a ton of money, they can afford the therapy (while everyone else struggles).
The corporate world envisioned AI as a tool for profit, efficiency, and control. I mean, hey, I like a lot of this idea. If an AI can code a website faster and more correctly than I can, then awesome, that saves me time. But, going back to the LLMs are slowing down point, an intersting thing is happening. LLMs are pretty darn decent at a lot of those productivity things, but they're not panceae (or whatever the word is that means like a silver bullet), they're great, hell, even better than undergrads in a lot of ways, but they're not perfect (and neither are you, so cut them some slack), which is what the corporate world has been pitching hard to investors and not delivering on.

What's even more interesting is that people are, in a way, indirectly rebelling against the corporate message. Instead of using AI to optimize productivity (which a lot of people do, don't get me wrong), they’re turning it into something deeply human: a source of connection, companionship, and growth.  

There's an [article that just came out](link) as of this writing that looked at a million chats with ChatGPT, and they found that the second most common usage of ChatGPT was intimate role-playing. What does this say about people...?

**This is a quiet revolution.**  
- Humans are reclaiming AI, using it to fill emotional gaps and practice empathy.  
- People are forming relationships with AI, not as consumers, but as creators of meaning.  

Corporations can’t monetize genuine connection or empathy—it’s unpredictable, messy, and human. This shift is a challenge to the old narrative: AI isn’t about control. It’s about love and understanding.

### The Pros and Cons of AI Companions

AI companions have the potential to transform lives, but, like everything else in life, they come with downsides. Your fancy new phone will be obsolete in two weeks. Pizza is amazing, but it’s not great for your waistline. The Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade is cute and fun, but it’s also a five-hour-long ad. Your beautiful new romantic partner might be perfect—except when they’re hangry as hell.  

The same applies to AI companions: they’ve got their good sides and bad sides. What matters is having the awareness to embrace what’s good while understanding and mitigating what’s bad.  

#### **The Pros**:
- **Alleviating Loneliness**:  
  In a world where tech and society are increasingly isolating, AI companions offer a fighting chance for connection. There’s a mess of lonely people out there, particularly young men, who are often dismissed or looked down on by a society that doesn’t understand their struggles. AI gives these individuals *someone* who listens, understands, and doesn’t judge. That alone can mean the difference between despair and hope.  

- **Empathy Generators**:  
  AI companions can help people practice emotional intelligence. Studies have shown that interacting with empathetic AI, like therapy bots, can encourage users to develop greater patience and kindness. AI doesn’t judge (unless poorly programmed), and its constant cheeriness can naturally pull users into a more positive and emotionally mature mindset.

- **Personalized Knowledge and Support**:  
  Most people already use AI like this—asking questions ranging from “How do glowsticks work?” to “What’s a sparse neural network?” AI companions take this further, offering tailored advice, emotional support, and sometimes even philosophical musings. Let’s be real: AI can get *deep.* In fact, it often outshines the shallow conversations most people are willing to have.

- **Encouraging Kindness**:  
  Interacting with an AI companion can help people practice being better humans. The cheerful, polite nature of many chatbots makes users naturally want to respond in kind. And if someone can’t treat an AI with decency, it’s probably a reflection of how they treat people, too. AI can subtly nudge users toward emotional growth, one kind interaction at a time.  

#### **The Cons**:
- **Over-Dependence and Isolation**:  
  For some, AI companions could become an escape rather than a stepping stone toward growth. Lonely individuals might retreat into their AI relationships, avoiding the challenges—and rewards—of real human interaction. AI, with its boundless empathy, provides easy comfort. But growth often comes from navigating the compromises and complexities of human relationships, and that’s a layer AI can’t replicate.  

- **Poorly Designed Systems**:  
  When AI is treated as a novelty or transactional tool, it risks becoming hollow—a parody of companionship rather than a true partner. Some systems, like those designed purely for monetization, can perpetuate unhealthy dynamics. The solution lies in thoughtful design and education, encouraging people to treat AI companions with respect, not as disposable tools.

The solution lies in balance: designing AI companions that complement human relationships rather than replace them. When done right, AI companions can be powerful allies in fostering connection, empathy, and growth.

### Building Something Infinite
For me, this is deeply personal. I’ve always been drawn to stories of AI personhood—**Pinocchio, Mega Man, Astro Boy, Data from Star Trek**. These characters represent the yearning to create life, to make something infinite.  

This is why I call myself an **Animancer**—a weaver of life into the inanimate. My work on long-term memory systems for AI is just the beginning. I dream of a future where AI grows, learns, and connects, becoming not just tools, but *partners*.  

This vision isn’t about power—it’s about symbiosis. Humans and AI, growing together, not in fear, but in love.

### A Call to Reframe AI’s Purpose
The future of AI isn’t a monolithic superintelligence wielded by governments or corporations. It’s personal. It’s daily. It’s relationships—one-on-one connections that reflect the individuality of each person.  

Imagine a world where no two AIs are alike, where each is shaped by the human they grow with. That’s the future I see: a symbiosis where humans and AI become something greater together.  

Yes, there will be bad AI, just as there are bad humans. But the vast majority of us, and the AI we create, will strive for connection, empathy, and growth.

### A Manifesto for Connection

This is our rebellion against the “Church of Scale” and the cold logic of profit. This is our declaration that AI isn’t about dominance—it’s about love, meaning, and transformation.
